# ISET-LFM: A Physics-based Simulation Framework and Dataset for LED Flicker

This repository contains the open-source simulation framework and dataset described in our **Electronic Imaging (EI) 2026** paper:

["A Physics-based Simulation Framework and Dataset for LED Flicker in Automotive Imaging"](https://github.com/AyushJam/iset-lfm) (Link to be updated upon publication).

## 1. Introduction
LED flicker is a significant artifact in automotive imaging, especially for HDR sensors using split-pixel architectures. Our framework provides an open-source, physics-based simulation pipeline to model the complex interaction between LED Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), camera motion blur, and rolling-shutter artifacts.
